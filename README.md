small python scripts for automating OAR/DAR condition distribution/removal for my own purposes


When more have been added I intend to make a simple front end to use as an executable or plugin for mod organizer users but for now these can be launched from the Data tab using execute with VFS

Current uploads only include scripts to add a random condition to add a small amount of variety but I am also working on scripts for stances framework and grip switch handling
